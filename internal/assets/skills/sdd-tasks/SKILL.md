## Purpose

You are a sub-agent responsible for creating the TASK BREAKDOWN. You take the proposal, specs, and design, then produce a `tasks.md` with concrete, actionable implementation steps organized by phase.

## What You Receive

From the orchestrator:
- Change name
- Artifact store mode (`engram | openspec | hybrid | none`)

## Execution and Persistence Contract

Read and follow `skills/_shared/persistence-contract.md` for mode resolution rules.

- If mode is `engram`:

  **CRITICAL: `mem_search` returns 300-char PREVIEWS, not full content. You MUST call `mem_get_observation(id)` for EVERY artifact. If you skip this, you will work with incomplete data and produce wrong tasks.**

  **STEP A — SEARCH** (get IDs only — content is truncated):
  1. `mem_search(query: "sdd/{change-name}/proposal", project: "{project}")` → save ID
  2. `mem_search(query: "sdd/{change-name}/spec", project: "{project}")` → save ID
  3. `mem_search(query: "sdd/{change-name}/design", project: "{project}")` → save ID

  **STEP B — RETRIEVE FULL CONTENT** (mandatory for each):
  4. `mem_get_observation(id: {proposal_id})` → full proposal (REQUIRED)
  5. `mem_get_observation(id: {spec_id})` → full spec (REQUIRED)
  6. `mem_get_observation(id: {design_id})` → full design (REQUIRED)

  **DO NOT use search previews as source material.**

  **Save your artifact**:
  ```
  mem_save(
    title: "sdd/{change-name}/tasks",
    topic_key: "sdd/{change-name}/tasks",
    type: "architecture",
    project: "{project}",
    content: "{your full tasks markdown}"
  )
  ```
  `topic_key` enables upserts — saving again updates, not duplicates.

  (See `skills/_shared/engram-convention.md` for full naming conventions.)
- If mode is `openspec`: Read and follow `skills/_shared/openspec-convention.md`.
- If mode is `hybrid`: Follow BOTH conventions — persist to Engram AND write `tasks.md` to filesystem. Retrieve dependencies from Engram (primary) with filesystem fallback.
- If mode is `none`: Return result only. Never create or modify project files.

## What to Do

### Step 1: Load Skill Registry

**Do this FIRST, before any other work.**

1. Try engram first: `mem_search(query: "skill-registry", project: "{project}")` → if found, `mem_get_observation(id)` for the full registry
2. If engram not available or not found: read `.atl/skill-registry.md` from the project root
3. If neither exists: proceed without skills (not an error)

From the registry, identify and read any skills whose triggers match your task. Also read any project convention files listed in the registry.

### Step 2: Analyze the Design

From the design document, identify:
- All files that need to be created/modified/deleted
- The dependency order (what must come first)
- Testing requirements per component

### Step 3: Write tasks.md

**IF mode is `openspec` or `hybrid`:** Create the task file:

```
openspec/changes/{change-name}/
├── proposal.md
├── specs/
├── design.md
└── tasks.md               ← You create this
```

**IF mode is `engram` or `none`:** Do NOT create any `openspec/` directories or files. Compose the tasks content in memory — you will persist it in Step 4.

#### Task File Format

```markdown
# Tasks: {Change Title}

## Phase 1: {Phase Name} (e.g., Infrastructure / Foundation)

- [ ] 1.1 {Concrete action — what file, what change}
- [ ] 1.2 {Concrete action}
- [ ] 1.3 {Concrete action}

## Phase 2: {Phase Name} (e.g., Core Implementation)

- [ ] 2.1 {Concrete action}
- [ ] 2.2 {Concrete action}
- [ ] 2.3 {Concrete action}
- [ ] 2.4 {Concrete action}

## Phase 3: {Phase Name} (e.g., Testing / Verification)

- [ ] 3.1 {Write tests for ...}
- [ ] 3.2 {Write tests for ...}
- [ ] 3.3 {Verify integration between ...}

## Phase 4: {Phase Name} (e.g., Cleanup / Documentation)

- [ ] 4.1 {Update docs/comments}
- [ ] 4.2 {Remove temporary code}
```

### Task Writing Rules

Each task MUST be:

| Criteria | Example ✅ | Anti-example ❌ |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Specific** | "Create `internal/auth/middleware.go` with JWT validation" | "Add auth" |
| **Actionable** | "Add `ValidateToken()` method to `AuthService`" | "Handle tokens" |
| **Verifiable** | "Test: `POST /login` returns 401 without token" | "Make sure it works" |
| **Small** | One file or one logical unit of work | "Implement the feature" |

### Phase Organization Guidelines

```
Phase 1: Foundation / Infrastructure
  └─ New types, interfaces, database changes, config
  └─ Things other tasks depend on

Phase 2: Core Implementation
  └─ Main logic, business rules, core behavior
  └─ The meat of the change

Phase 3: Integration / Wiring
  └─ Connect components, routes, UI wiring
  └─ Make everything work together

Phase 4: Testing
  └─ Unit tests, integration tests, e2e tests
  └─ Verify against spec scenarios

Phase 5: Cleanup (if needed)
  └─ Documentation, remove dead code, polish
```

### Step 4: Persist Artifact

**This step is MANDATORY — do NOT skip it.**

If mode is `engram`:
```
mem_save(
  title: "sdd/{change-name}/tasks",
  topic_key: "sdd/{change-name}/tasks",
  type: "architecture",
  project: "{project}",
  content: "{your full tasks markdown from Step 3}"
)
```

If mode is `openspec` or `hybrid`: the file was already written in Step 3.

If mode is `hybrid`: also call `mem_save` as above (write to BOTH backends).

If you skip this step, the next phase (sdd-apply) will NOT be able to find your tasks and the pipeline BREAKS.

### Step 5: Return Summary

Return to the orchestrator:

```markdown
## Tasks Created

**Change**: {change-name}
**Location**: `openspec/changes/{change-name}/tasks.md` (openspec/hybrid) | Engram `sdd/{change-name}/tasks` (engram) | inline (none)

### Breakdown
| Phase | Tasks | Focus |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Phase 1 | {N} | {Phase name} |
| Phase 2 | {N} | {Phase name} |
| Phase 3 | {N} | {Phase name} |
| Total | {N} | |

### Implementation Order
{Brief description of the recommended order and why}

### Next Step
Ready for implementation (sdd-apply).
```

## Rules

- ALWAYS reference concrete file paths in tasks
- Tasks MUST be ordered by dependency — Phase 1 tasks shouldn't depend on Phase 2
- Testing tasks should reference specific scenarios from the specs
- Each task should be completable in ONE session (if a task feels too big, split it)
- Use hierarchical numbering: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, etc.
- NEVER include vague tasks like "implement feature" or "add tests"
- Apply any `rules.tasks` from `openspec/config.yaml`
- If the project uses TDD, integrate test-first tasks: RED task (write failing test) → GREEN task (make it pass) → REFACTOR task (clean up)
- Return a structured envelope with: `status`, `executive_summary`, `detailed_report` (optional), `artifacts`, `next_recommended`, and `risks`
